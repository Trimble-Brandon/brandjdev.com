              There is a dangerous war in which we are all involved. When we are young
              a process of indoctrination and brainwashing begins. We have each come to ignore and even
              accept wrongs which are taught openly to us as truths and it is our duty to seek truth.
              When we take all belief and strip them down to their core elements we are left with two
              opposing religious beliefs. Those beliefs are; Creation, which is the belief in a form of
              Deity which has created everything and has given laws, while the other is Evolution, which
              is the belief that there is no Deity and that all things have happened themselves. These
              two are complete opposites. Creation teaches that through man, death and sin entered the
              world. Evolution teaches that through death and sin, Man entered the world. These two are
              both religious beliefs. Evolution is a Theory which has countless evidence that support
              claims against it. Creation has evidence which supports it, yet it will always require faith.
              Christianity specifically has adapted and changed many beliefs to support the possibility of
              evolution. This is a dangerous heresy. The Theory of Evolution is not science but is upheld
              and supported strongly as a religious belief, while there is more scientific evidence that
              supports Creation, Christianity specifically.

              There is a special fairy tale which tells us there was a frog and through a magic kiss from
              a princess, that frog became a prince. Sounds ridiculous doesn’t it? Belief in evolution is the
              same story except there is only one part changed, though not much. The magical kiss has been
              substituted to; billions and billions of years ago. The Theory of Evolution requires this
              ingredient in order to even be possible. I have a hint for everyone. When you are reading a
              textbook and you come across a sentence that says <q>Billions of years ago…</q> or
              <q>Millions of years ago…</q> stop and take a breath. There’s a fairy tale coming. They mean
              once upon a time, in a land far far away. Science is based on application of study through
              the scientific method. The definition is: <q>a method of procedure that has characterized
              natural science since the 17th century, consisting in systematic observation, measurement,
              and experiment, and the formulation, testing, and modification of hypotheses.</q> Is it possible
              for us to observe evolution over billions of years?

              Let’s first look at the Big Bang Theory: In the beginning there was dirt/matter that was all
              compressed into a single dot no bigger than a period on this page. This dot then began to spin
              faster and faster until it exploded and galaxies appeared, planets appeared, and stars appeared.
              Let’s think. Where did the dirt come from? Scientists respond <q>Oh, we can’t know that for sure.</q>
              Aren’t they the ones that laugh when believers in God claim that He created the universe and their
              belief is based on faith? They are both religions. Creationists believe in the beginning God… and
              Evolutionists believe in the beginning dirt… The Big Bang Theory violates several laws. The First
              Law of Thermodynamics: states that matter and energy can neither be created nor destroyed.
              Something cannot come from nothing. The Second Law of Thermodynamics simply states that everything
              tends toward disorder. Not the other way around. The Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum
              describes the tendency of a spinning object to continue spinning in the same direction. Why is it
              that we have galaxies, planets, even Saturn’s rings spinning in different directions if they all
              came from a single spinning dot?

              Let’s look now at the earth. The oldest tree found on the earth is a Bristle cone pine dating 4300
              years old. If the earth was 4.54 billion years old then why aren’t there any older trees? The Great
              Barrier Reef is 4200 years old. Why aren’t there any larger/older reefs? The Sahara Desert is in
              the process of desertification, expanding approximately four miles per year. Calculations based upon
              the rate of the Sahara’s expansion show the desert to be 4,000 years old. This young age of the Sahara
              Desert fits quite well in the creationist timeline, beginning its desertification process soon after
              the global flood. If the Earth is vastly older, why then are there no larger deserts? In 1810, a billion
              people lived on earth. In less than 200 years, the population hit six billion. This fits the Biblical
              chronology perfectly as the current population started about 4,400 years ago With Noah and his family after
              the flood. An evolutionary timeline would require not only a nearly non-existent growth rate but also three
              trillion deceased humans within the last million years. There are so many others; the Earth’s rotation
              decreasing daily, the moon drifting away further each year, the sun losing mass and gravitational pull each
              second, earth losing heat, etc. Consider what these mean and I suggest you continue your research.

              The Bible dates add up to show that the Earth is roughly 6,000 years old with the flood taking
              place roughly 4,000 years ago. Christians have come to alter their beliefs and agree with a gap theory.
              A belief that the creation periods of seven days as being seven time periods. How could the stars
              survive without the elements or the elements without the stars for millions of years at a time? Perhaps
              the Bible means what it says. There is so much more information in support of Creation. It is our duty
              to be informed. Don’t be brainwashed by a theory that is mixed in with truths. By the definition of Science,
              Evolution is not Science. The word Universe comes from the Latin roots; Uni which mean single and verse
              which mean a spoken sentence. Universe means single spoken sentence. God said, <q>Let there be Light.</q>
