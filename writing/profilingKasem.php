          	<p class="intro postContent">I lean forward, instinctively, in my chair as the call connects and Kasem comes on screen.</p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>Hello bro!</q> He doesn't even miss a beat into the call all while cracking a grin. His glasses lift
          slightly off the bridge of his nose when he smiles and I can't help but laugh.</p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>Hey buddy how are you?!</q> I respond as I laugh. <q>You are back in Albania then?</q> I see the line of heads
					behind him facing the low glow of the computers each were using. Bookshelves line the walls in the distance. I hear soft clacking
					of keyboards and low whispers from the others in the room. Kasem's brow furrows and his eyebrows raise, revealing four lines in
					his forehead. His eyes get very wide and shifty while he responds in a lower tone.</p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>You know, is very hard bro. My father no can find work. His back still very big problem, but is alright.
					I am with family and find job as chef.</q> Empathy fills me all while my mind is recalled at his mention of chef. He loved cooking
					and always talked about working in kitchens as a cook and wanting to be a chef. As a missionary, any time I went to visit Kasem,
					he had some kind of food waiting. I quickly learned to be hungry when visiting and that he would not take no for an answer and
					never accepted excuses of not being able to stay long. Food was artfully crafted and displayed. He used a plate like a canvas,
					using the distinct flavors to create. I thought back with fondness of our discussions that helped me to understand and helped
					cultivate my desire to learn of other cultures and beliefs.</p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>I hope your father begins to feel well again so he can be by your side while you fulfill your dream!</q>
					He lit up at this and was back to grinning. <q>Kasem, I told you a bit about what I wanted to talk to you about today. You okay if
					we get started?</q> His smile didn't fade as he leaned back in his chair for a moment then sat up straight.</p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>Ah yes bro! Our talks. The council was all business after you left.</q> He was referring to a council in
					the city of Leicester, England that was set up to represent all the different faiths that were in Leicester. There were Muslims,
					Sikh, Hindi, multiple variations of Christianity, Jews, and more that I didn't learn the names of. Originally the Second Counselor
					to the Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day Saints represented on the council but he had become ill and we, the
					missionaries, were asked to fill in. This was a great opportunity and had been how I met Kasem.</p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>Okay! I know you are going to laugh about this question, but I wanted to get general information. So,
					are all Muslims from Arab countries?</q> I had guessed right. It did amuse Kasem enough to where he disturbed the others around
					him. He didn't apologize. He was always very dramatic. Mostly this amused him because he always teased myself and other
					missionaries from America that we were very ignorant. Bantering back with him I had always defended my pride as an American.
					This question was a trap and I had known it. When he had recollected himself he gleefully responded to me with the pride that I was
          expecting.</p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>No, oh no! Islam originate on Mars!</q> He may be from Albania, but Kasem had British humor to his core.
					<q>Islam mostly in India, much in Africa and Asia. Is found all over the world but these countries it have high amount of people.</q>
					He recollected himself as I shook my head slowly at him smiling. I had almost forgotten just how much Kasem reminded me of Bumi from
					<u>Avatar: The Last Airbender</u> sometimes. Mad genius...</p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>Most want to know about the differences in belief about Jesus. Many who aren't that familiar about Islam
          at least know that Muslims believe there was a Jesus...</q></p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>Jesus was great Prophet, like Muhammad, peace be upon him.</q> I smiled at him as he cut in. I should have
					known he would interject here. There seemed to be a no-nonsense policy in force regarding Jesus. This was also a topic that we had
					talked much about. There is a detail that always didn't make sense to me. Perhaps he will explain it differently now.</p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>I remember! Though a part I didn't understand. Muslims believe that Jesus did not die?</q> He nodded
        	intrigued that I had not understood this before.</p>

        	<p class="postContent"><q>Jesus, as prophet is regarded higher than Muhammad, peace be upon him. Jesus was raised into heaven by
					Allah and did not die. This so he can return at the end and teach the world from the Quran.</q> The detail had not changed. I
					wanted to dive into this but knew I needed to move on with the other questions. Kasem was limited on time with the computer he was
					using. His mention of Allah made it easy to transition into my next question.</p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>It is perfect that you mentioned Allah. Is that God's name or is the word <em>God</em> ever used by Muslims.</q>
					He seemed disappointed that we had not talked more on our differing view of Jesus. It seemed a fleeting moment of disappointment as
					he was back to smiling at this new question.</p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>This very simple. <em>Allah</em> Arabic word for God. Arabs of Christian or Jewish faith also use <em>Allah</em>.</q>
					He leaned back in his chair, pleased with the clever simplicity of the answer. I could feel my eyebrows raised. I had not expected that at all.
					What a simple explanation. I figured that even if it had been a different name it was still the name for the one we both consider
					Father of all creation.</p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>How similar we all really are, my friend.</q> I found myself lost in previous discussions we had, as well
        	as the many other people I had been lucky to meet. He didn't let my mind wander long.</p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>Bro, I try to find true difference in all my life. I learn that difference in practice, but in heart...</q>
					he gestured to the center of his chest, his hands still covered in scars from the cuts and the burns. <q> ...we the same. Mind...</q>
					both hands now grasping the top of his head, quickly moved down to gesture to the center of his chest again. <q>corrupts heart.</q>
					I nodded along with what he said. In the church we learn that all are children of God. Along the way we all forget more often than
					we should allow.</p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>Kasem can you tell me about where the Quran came from?</q></p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>Quran is entire teachings of Allah from angel Gabriel to Muhammad, peace be upon him. He memorize
					teachings and taught others. He have chosen followers remember all teaching. Many years go by and decision made to write teachings down.
					Becomes Holy Quran.</q></p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>And do Muslims believe any part of the Bible?</q> He smiled knowingly at this.</p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>Ah, many parts from Torah, or Older Testament. Holy line follow Ishmael, not Abraham.</q></p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>When people convert to Islam, how does it work?</q> He coughed a few times and immediately grinned widely
          while looking around. This piqued my curiosity, but I thought better to forget about it. Bumi right?</p>

      		<p class="postContent"><q>To be true follower of Islam, must declare Allah is only God, no sons...</q> he smirked almost pointing at
					me with his nose. <q>...and declare Muhammad, peace be upon him, is Allah's messenger. Is called Shahada!</q>
          He started fidgeting, looking around.</p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>Kasem, you almost out of time?</q></p>

        	<p class="postContent"><q>Oh yes bro, is very bad. They don't give enough time here.</q> He shook his head and then began to poke the
					screen of the computer, as if to knock a quarter loose that would give him more time. I laughed. I couldn't help it.</p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>Well, buddy thanks for letting me interview you, somewhat formally for this. We will have to talk again
          soon. Tell me how the council meetings are going.</q></p>

          <p class="postContent"><q>Yes yes bro we will. Maybe soon I see America. I love America. Someday soon I will see.</q> His gaze
					wandered slightly while he thought about his plans to see America. <q>Talk to you later bro, timer is
					ticking me off.</q> I waved and the connection ended. I sat back thinking now on the meals that he would
					cook for us when we would meet. The different flavors that were used to create the end masterpiece.
					Years of practice to perfect the art. No good dish is ever made with one flavor.</p>
