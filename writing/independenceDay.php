              <p class="intro postContent">Fireworks, barbecues, face paint, the lake, guns and beer. Most of these are
                    staples for Americans on the fourth of July, our Independence Day. This day is represented as
                    the historical day when the American colonies signed the Declaration of Independence. This day
                    holds its historical value and though it is celebrated as a day of independence from tyrannical
                    British rule, it should also be celebrated as the beginning of America and Britain boldly
                    standing together.</p>

                    <p class="postContent">A movie that is a mark of my childhood is in fact, the movie Independence Day. For my young
                    self it was a wonder of mankind verses aliens, jets and spaceships. I still cheesily watch this
                    movie at least every Fourth of July. It is a tradition for me among others that I enjoy on this
                    day. What has always stood out to me in the movie is humanity uniting together against a
                    threatening enemy. Why is it that we need a greater threat to lay our differences aside and unite?</p>

                    <p class="postContent">I have ancestors that came from Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England. I spent two years in
                    England and have returned there several times. I love it there and there are many people, who I
                    love, that have made a lasting impact on me. I found it ironic but they will likely think it
                    cheeky of me to recognize that Britain’s exit from the European Union has taken place so close to
                    our Independence Day. I want the people of England to know that although we zealously celebrate our
                    independence as a nation, that it does not undermine our love and respect for you. We stand with
                    you. Independence as a country does not mean you are alone.</p>

                    <p class="postContent">Let’s take this day as a reminder that we must stand together. Americans, today we are united in
                    love for this country. Tomorrow we will return to fighting amongst each other about guns, religion,
                    who should be president, drugs, law enforcement, immigration, wars etc. Let us take a moment to
                    remember that different opinions are healthy but there are better ways than clawing at each other
                    and foaming at the mouth.</p>

                    <p class="postContent">A wise Welsh woman once said to me, <q>Where you step today, determines where you stand tomorrow.</q>
                    Decide today that tomorrow we will step away from party squabbles and into making a difference and
                    change in this country and then into the world.</p>
