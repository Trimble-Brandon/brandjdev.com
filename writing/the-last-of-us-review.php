              <h2>Video Games Setting the Standard For Interactive Storytelling</h2>
              <p class="intro postContent">
                I consider myself an avid consumer of creativity. I love books, movies, paintings,
                music, video games and everything between. To me each of these are based on stories.
                There is an experience and story behind every work of art that brings it to life and
                gives it meaning. This causes a resonance in people that differs from person to
                person. Each person connects differently and either cares for the story and finds
                meaning or doesn't connect with it.
              </p>

              <p class="postContent">
                Let's take a look at a few different forms of art and the points that support them
                being considered art. We'll start with the earliest/basic forms. I am not going to
                go hugely in-depth, just introduce and cover some basic concepts.
              </p>

              <section id="paintings_drawings">
                <h3>Paintings/Drawings</h3>

                <p class="postContent">
                  Paintings, drawings etc. are visually stimulating. Color, shapes, light, characters,
                  scenes etc. are used to tell a story. The artist generally has that story in their
                  mind when they are creating, however the interpretation is often left up to the
                  viewer.
                </p>
              </section>

              <section id="music">
                <h3>Music</h3>

                <p class="postContent">
                  Stimulated through listening, music is art that is very emotionally stirring.
                  Music is also a story being told that is very capable at setting the mood
                  of a listener.
                </p>
              </section>

              <section id="writing">
                <h3>Writing</h3>

                <p class="postContent">
                  Writing is interesting because it is an accumulated art form. A person reads
                  and forms what is presented in their minds. The art is entirely made piece by
                  piece. Writing allows the writer to control information or the pieces a person
                  receives by the piece, building up and creating a full picture.
                </p>
              </section>

              <p class="postContent">
                These would be the early basic forms of art. <strong>Photography</strong> has to be noted as a branch
                of painting/drawing coming about with the invention of cameras. The capability to
                capture a moment in time that uses the same visual styles of paintings and drawings.
                This leads to the cumulative art form of Film, Movies and Television. Whatever you
                want to call it, the idea is the same.
              </p>

              <section id="theatre">
                <h3>Theatre</h3>

                <p class="postContent">
                  The raw combining of music and visuals. Actors are also introduced as forms of art
                  where a person portrays the emotions of a character. A play has the advantage of
                  being live and in the moment which gives a special characteristic and sets itself apart.
                </p>
              </section>

              <section id="film">
                <h3>Film</h3>

                <p class="postContent">
                  Story that is written as a blueprint and told through dialogue, visuals and music. Film
                  has the beautiful capability of presenting all of these together to create a full experience.
                  Building on the experience that Theatre introduced. Film gives powerful control over how a
                  person is seeing the story through cinematography.
                </p>
              </section>

              <section id="videogames">
                <h3>Video Games</h3>

                <p class="postContent">
                  This brings us into Video Games. Like all the arts mentioned previously, there are many different
                  forms that can be appreciated for their different characteristics. I want to focus on story
                  driven Video Games as my example.
                </p>

                <p class="postContent">
                  The primary aspect that sets Video Games apart is the interactivity of the story. You control
                  a character or characters and make choices and help them progress through the story. Video
                  Games have the benefit of visual stimulation through cinematography, stimulation through
                  listening with music and sound design, emotional portrayal from actors with the rapidly
                  evolving capabilities of motion capture, and the playerâ€™s having the chance to have an active
                  part in the story. This brings us to my chosen example of the massive award winning
                  <a href="http://www.thelastofus.playstation.com/index.html" target="_blank">The Last of Us</a> created
                  by Naughty Dog with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Druckmann" target="_blank">Neil Druckmann</a> as the
                  creative director and writer.

                In all projects; books, art, videos, movies, television, video games, etc. it quickly becomes
                obvious where the motivations lie for the project. Priorities are important and they lend to
                the emotion and quality of any project.
              </p>

              <p class="postContent">
                The Last of Us makes it very clear very quickly that this game is a passion project. Everyone
                involved gave their all and their passion is apparent in this phenomenal finished product.
                Neil Druckmann has given interviews where he talks about his inspirations for creating
                The Last of Us. These are all technical inspirations he talks about. Whatever the emotional
                driving force behind this storytelling, all I can say is thank you to Neil for sharing this
                with the world.
              </p>

              <p class="postContent">
                The actors are incredible and again it is apparent they gave their all. Each actor is to be
                commended and I will go more in depth in the analysis for each of them.

                The soundtrack is iconic and beautifully delivered. Each track builds the emotion
                throughout the game. Watching the composer,
                <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0763395/" target="_blank">Gustavo Santaolalla</a>, live
                is also a treat to see his love for this music he has created. I keep my eye wary for
                the vinyl release of this soundtrack. Listen if you would like!
              </p>

              <p class="postContent">
                Each credited member of the development team must be commended as well. They are not
                in the interviews, their names arenâ€™t plastered across the headlines and they donâ€™t
                receive personal awards. I hope each of them are proud of what they have accomplished
                together. Without them this story would not have been brought to life as well as it has.
                This game took the time to pay precise attention to detail and it does not go without
                notice. Thank you to all of you.
              </p>

              <p class="postContent">
                The Last of Us takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where, rather than the usual zombie
                experience, the epidemic comes from a real infection strain called Cordyceps. Cordyceps
                in our real world is specific to only insects, though in the game the infection obviously
                has mutated and infects humans. This infection grows in the body and takes over the brain
                causing increased agitation, extreme muscle spasms, bloating and fungal growth. Eventually
                when the body is dead the fungal growth extends out of the body reaching for light and
                emitting spores to spread the infection.
              </p>

              <p class="postContent">
                This adds an interesting dynamic to the story and a much needed change in the Zombie Genre.
                The Last of Us cannot be considered simply a zombie story, so donâ€™t roll your eyes at the
                thought of another zombie setting. The apocalyptic infection builds aspects of the world.
              </p>

              <p class="postContent">
                The story of The Last of Us is rooted in the characters. Primarily the main two. This is the
                story of Joel and Ellie. This is a dark game in tone and heavy in emotion, with
                Creative Director and writer, Neil Druckmann, working hard to present the realism that this
                sort of world would bring. This story, despite having traumatic events, has beautiful moments
                that will have you beaming and unashamedly in tears. It is a story about humanity, strength,
                survival, relationships, determination, tragedy and love.
              </p>

              <p id="watchingOptions" class="postContent">
                Simply put, The Last of Us is a modern masterpiece that must be experienced by anyone who
                appreciate masterfully written and portrayed stories. If you play video games, get this
                game. If you are someone who does not like video games, I highly recommend this story. It
                is a story that must be experienced and so I have two options for you.
              </p>

              <p class="postContent">
                One option is to watch someone play through the game. I highly suggest watching Bri White.
                Her first few videos she falls into the trap that most Youtubers fall into when doing
                <q>Let's Plays</q>. She tries too hard and doesnt come across very genuine in the first
                few videos. She quickly becomes invested in the story and she is fun to watch while giving
                great commentary that is entertaining, insightful and genuinely sincere.<br />
                <br />

              </div>

              <p class="postContent">
                The other option that I suggest and highly recommend even if you choose to watch Bri first,
                is a fantastic cinematic version of the game that was done by a fan. Check out his youtube
                channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GmoneyProductions29">here</a>. The
                video series is done in episodes much like a TV show. He has cut out much of the gameplay
                to focus on the story. His video series has been praised and shared by both Neil Druckmann
                and Ashley Johnson.<br />
