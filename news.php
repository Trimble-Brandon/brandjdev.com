						Along with my classes I have been slowly implementing more of what
						I have learned and have completed new iterations of this site. I
						have fully completed the homepage and decided to push the changes to
						the server. At this time I have completed bringing the about page
						in line and am currently working on this, the news page. My next
						update to the news will likely be when I have completed bring all
						the pages in line. This should not take me very long.

						It has been some time since I have made updates to the site! My trip to Norway was
						fantastic and I will have content for that trip up soon! When I got back from my
						trip I was tossed into a new full semester of school. My classes have kept me busy!
						Most website related work has been a build up but expect big changes coming soon.
						I have been learning different frameworks on the side and having built this site
						entirely using my own framework, I am going to be implementing Bootstrap soon.
						Much of my schoolwork is required to be posted to a Wordpress blog. Once those classes
						are over I will move the content into a permanent place on this website. The link
						for my design portfolio is
						here<.
						There is also a journal there for my Web Business class. If you are interested in that
						it can be found through the links on that page or you can simply click
						here.
						This class will also be requiring changes to the site soon. Expect a lot coming
						now that the buildup of my classes are coming to the web itself! I am also going
						to have another project coming online soon. More information on that will come
						later. Thank you so much everyone!

						Alright! Added icon to site head. Icon will appear in tabs and next to URL. Removed Video,
						Audio, and Contact pages. Removed links for Video, Audio, and Contact pages from the Nav Bar.
						Contact is now highlighting my social pages. This has been added to the side bar and the
						icons are still available in the footer. A few posts in the past included a tweet for the
						post and to encourage discussion. This will be continued for all posts moving forward.
						Discussion, questions and requests to my twitter. Possibility of embedding Discord into
						the site in the future. I am still thinking about it and currently want Twitter to be
						the main driving force of contact. Removed links to site plan and teaching presentation.
						Site plan will still be available via a link on the About page.

						Finals finished, Semester ended, grades posted, and extension on site for final is archived!
						I am taking a full semester length math course over the course of the next 6 weeks before the
						fall semester starts. This has captivated a lot of time and I am still trying to enjoy summer!
						However, I am going to try to still dedicate time to some restructuring of the site to remove
						the class required elements. I am visiting Norway for three weeks at the end of the month and
						I get a lot of questions about the airline I use for affordability, what places I stay, how
						I pack and why I chose Norway to visit, so I am going to have a chain of posts for Norway!
						I'll be answering those prep questions and then posting about the places I visit while I am
						there. So check it out!
