          <h2>About Site</h2>

          <p>
            The purpose of this website is to be a portfolio to display samples of written
            work and in itself be an example of my web development. I love writing and want to
            be able to share this writing with those who may appreciate it and give me valuable
            feedback. It will work also as a blog. It will have written entries covering trips
            I make, or events that take place that I have thoughts on.

            <p>
              My name is Brand and I am twenty-three years old and going to
              school for Web design and development. Ever since I was young I have loved writing
              and have found many hobbies in computers. My writing started with exaggeration.
              Looking back at my young age, my parents would call it fibbing. It got me in
              trouble but eventually I learned to differentiate between using the exaggeration
              to enhance stories for entertainment, and exaggerating the truth.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am a weird hybrid of loving analog and digital.
              I appreciate antiques while also under the awing glow of computers. I am the oldest of
              two brothers and a sister. I have a strong religious background, being a Mormon and
              on a personal level finding God for myself.
            </p>

            <p>
              I love camping, traveling, causing mischief,
              learning, gaming, competing, developing, reading, and writing. I played football in Highschool
              but find myself playing the other football(soccer) now. I am an Eagle Scout. I served a
              full-time, two year mission for my church in England. I am a very proud Viking descendant.
            </p>

            <p>
              In me you will find an interesting, different and growing perspective.
            </p>
