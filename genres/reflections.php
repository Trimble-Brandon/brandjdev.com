            <h2>I Believe in the Anchor of Hope</h2>
            <br />
            <p class="intro">
              Without an anchor a boat will drift. Without strong and deep roots in the midst of a storm, a tree
              will fall. Uneasy footing will end up with any person falling and feeling a bit foolish afterwards.
              Without an anchor, a steady assurance, we will lose ourselves. I believe in the Anchor of Hope. For, it
              is hope that gives us unwavering strength in the face of the onslaught of wind and fury of storm.

            <h2>Profiling Kasem</h2>
            <br />
            <p class="intro">I lean forward, instinctively, in my chair as the call connects and Kasem comes on screen.
            <q>Hello bro!</q> He doesn't even miss a beat into the call all while cracking a grin. His glasses lift
            slightly off the bridge of his nose when he smiles and I can't help but laugh.<br />
            <br />
            <q>Hey buddy how are you?!</q> I respond as I laugh. <q>You are back in Albania then?</q> I see the line of
            heads behind him facing the low glow of the computers each were using. Bookshelves line the walls in the
            distance. I hear soft clacking of keyboards and low whispers from the others in the room. Kasem's brow
            furrows and his eyebrows raise, revealing four lines in his forehead. His eyes get very wide and shifty
            while he responds in a lower tone....</p>

            <h2>Creation Vs Evolution</h2>
            <br />
            <p class="intro">There is a dangerous war in which we are all involved. When we are young a process
            of indoctrination and brainwashing begins. We have each come to ignore and even accept wrongs which
            are taught openly to us as truths and it is our duty to seek truth. When we take all belief and strip
            them down to their core elements we are left with two opposing religious beliefs. Those beliefs are;
            Creation, which is the belief in a form of Deity which has created everything and has given laws, while
            the other is Evolution, which is the belief that there is no Deity and that all things have happened themselves. </p>

            <h2>Independence Day</h2>
            <br />
            <p class="intro">
              Fireworks, barbecues, face paint, the lake, guns and beer. Most of these are
              staples for Americans on the fourth of July, our Independence Day. This day is represented as
              the historical day when the American colonies signed the Declaration of Independence. This day
              holds its historical value and though it is celebrated as a day of independence from tyrannical
              British rule, it should also be celebrated as the beginning of America and Britain boldly standing together.
